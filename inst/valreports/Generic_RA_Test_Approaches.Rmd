## Risk Assessment

A risk metric report will be generated as a basis for risk assessment. The default criteria for risk categorization can be adjusted to meet the specific needs of each organization.

## Test Approaches

Based on the outcome of the risk assessment, different testing approaches will be employed, and corresponding testing reports will be generated.

- **Low Risk Packages:** For packages categorized as low risk, unit tests are sufficient to verify that the package is installed correctly and functions as expected.

- **Medium Risk Packages:** For medium risk packages, examples or vignettes should be executed to verify the functionalities of the package.

- **High Risk Packages:** For high risk packages, separate system tests must be conducted to ensure comprehensive validation.

> This is merely a starting point for the full validation report. 


## Structure of a validation report folder

Table of contents:

- [ ] Risk metrics report
- [ ] Risk score / characterization
- [ ] Unit Test Report
- [ ] System Test Protocol
- [ ] Test Cases Definition
